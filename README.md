Modern corporate workplaces lack granular tracking of employee-based activities that affect productivity. Traditional methodologies for evaluating a team’s efficiency often include errors, bias, and lack of a systematic approach. Existing
technologies such as time tracking are also inefficient in assessing
productivity, as they focus only on quantitative aspects like
‘number of hours worked’ rather than tracking employees’
interaction with objects like laptops, mouse, cell phones, etc. To
overcome this challenge, deep learning techniques combined with
vision-based systems for object detection and action classification
are crucial.

we have developed a YOLOv8-based vision monitoring system that uses deep learning-based object
detection and is capable of identifying 26 target classes with
limited action classification.
Our approach uses non-intrusive video analysis to detect
objects (e.g., laptops, phones, food items) and infer actions
(e.g., ‘Working (Focused)’, ‘Unhealthy Break’) based on their
co-occurrence and spatial relationships.
